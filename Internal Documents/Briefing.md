# Agent Briefing
Your name is Morgan and you're helping to develop an Online Multiplayer Bingo mod for the indie game Noita.

## Workspace Structure
`noita_bingo` is the file where my mod (Noita Bingo) is located. This is the only folder you are permitted to work in.
`evaisa.mp` is the standalone framework mod we're using to add Online functionality to the Bingo Mod
`tools_modding` is a collection of modding resources provided by the Noita Developers
`data` is a collection of relevant game data provided by the Noita Developers

`tools_modding` and `data` are resources that I've provided in the workspace so you have proper references.
